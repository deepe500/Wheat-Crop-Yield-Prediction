# Wheat-Crop-Yield-Prediction

It's interesting to hear about the successful 95% accurate crop yield prediction for Patiala, Punjab, using ArcGIS software and an SVM machine learning model based on NDVI profiles.

NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used remote sensing indicator of vegetation health and greenness. It leverages differences in how healthy vegetation reflects red and near-infrared light. Higher NDVI values typically indicate denser, healthier vegetation cover.

SVM model: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning algorithms often used for classification tasks. In this case, the SVM likely classified different "subjects" (e.g., fields, farms) based on their NDVI profiles. It learned by analyzing labeled data where known crop types or yield levels were associated with specific NDVI values.

Data source: Presumably, the model used Landsat satellite imagery capturing NDVI values for different areas within Patiala.
Model training: The SVM model was trained on a representative dataset of NDVI profiles and corresponding crop yield data. This training data is crucial for the model to learn the relationship between NDVI and yield.
Accuracy: A 95% accuracy score is impressive, suggesting the model effectively predicted yield based on NDVI profiles. However, it's important to consider the confidence intervals and potential limitations of this accuracy metric.
